    // buy if it presses " " and then enter anotheer input, it will take both the inputs as per the required input here, x&y;
    // this is called buffering. "processor, the fast device and keyboard the slow device accomodate through buffering"
    
    
    // difference between endl and \n : Both endl and \n serve the same purpose in C++ â€“ they insert a new line. However, the key difference between them is that endl causes a flushing of the output buffer every time it is called, whereas \n does not.
